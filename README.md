Founded by former engineers from a major social media company, Social Buzz focuses on anonymous user engagement, emphasizing content rather than individual profiles. With a massive and diverse content pool, Social Buzz collects and manages substantial unstructured data each day. Now, they are preparing for an IPO and need external expertise to help scale their operations and implement best practices for big data management.
